# chez-httparse — subagent-driven development ledger

SLICE 1 — HARNESS PORT (byte-machine harness → chez-httparse). Branch
feat/gate0-harness-port.

Plan: .plans/2026-08-28-gate0-slice1-harness-port-design.md
Decisions: .plans/decisions/0001..0003 (Gate 0, 2026-08-28)
Base at start: 1e0c336 (local main; origin/main is behind by two commits).

Gate 0 complete 2026-08-28: naming + rename map (0001), byte-machine
consumption + generated ABI v2 target (0002), Slice 1 scope + exit criteria
(0003). Port map derived from a six-reader survey of the byte-machine tree at
commit 9561fa2 plus a completeness critic; the one open naming question the
survey surfaced (bare `byte-machine` token mapping) is settled by 0001.

Measured environment for this slice (2026-08-28, Darwin 25.5.0 arm64):
CMake/CTest 4.3.3; Chez 10.4.1 threaded (machine-type tarm64osx, brew,
binary name `chez`).

Slice 1 harness port, local phase complete 2026-08-28 (commits f49bd3a,
96ff723 + docs): 41 files ported under the 0001 rename map (six passes:
ByteMachine/BYTE_MACHINE/BYTE-MACHINE/byte_machine/byte-machine/_bm_,
1,696 replacements), test/CMakeLists.txt rewritten minimal (35 lanes),
SchemeMutationSuite rewritten to the harness passes. Fresh fixtures:
fingerprint sample `chez-httparse\n` (hex 1f2902297117b4a3, measured under
Chez 10.4.1 and cross-checked against an independent Python
reimplementation), regenerated stale-root copy. New rename-audit spec
(watched red on a planted token, then green; its first clean-tree run
caught a real miss: the fused wrong-prefix name in HttparseTestingSpec) —
witnessed by MutationSuite mutation 73. Upstream decision/plan citations
re-anchored with an "upstream" qualifier; Chez floor re-justified by this
repo's CI cells.

Exit criteria 1-3 and 5 measured green locally (make dev/test/test-all
35/35, no-scheme 9/9, closing rg sweep clean). Criterion 4 met 2026-08-28:
CI run 33213389847 on PR #1 (draft) completed success on both cells
(macos-arm64 brew cell; linux-amd64 source-built 10.4.1 cell including the
no-scheme step), 4m40s.

SLICE 1 EXIT CRITERIA: all five met. Awaiting review; closing ritual not
run (PR #1 left as draft for the human pass).

MERGE GATE (2026-08-28): PR #1 squash-merged as 99839ab "feat: Gate 0 +
Slice 1 — bootstrap on the byte-machine harness (#1)". Clean rebuild of
merged main: release preset 35/35, no-scheme preset 9/9 (Darwin 25.5.0
arm64, Chez 10.4.1 tarm64osx, CMake 4.3.3). CI on the PR head: run
33213389847, both cells success.

CLOSING RITUAL COMPLETE (2026-08-28; steps 1-4). Step 1: squash merge of
PR #1 (origin/main was first fast-forwarded b3fc6d8..1e0c336 so the squash
base was current). Step 2: local main fast-forwarded to 99839ab. Step 3:
feat/gate0-harness-port deleted locally (-D after an empty diff against
main) and on origin. Step 4 (retrospective, not a summary): what held up —
the survey-first port map made the rename mechanical and the ported
mutation suites did their job as the safety net (SITES caught nothing
because the literals moved in lockstep; the totals checks forced honest
recounts, 118->59 and 72->73 measured rather than carried). What nearly
slipped — two rename-miss classes the four-pass map cannot see (a fused
token with no separator; a token split across a comment line break), both
now Traps in AGENTS.md, and the first was caught by the new rename-audit
spec on its first clean-tree run, which is the prefer-a-check rule paying
for itself immediately. Standards routed to AGENTS.md this close: a
pointer to this ledger (nothing in the repo previously told a fresh
session it exists) and the push-main-before-squash-merge caveat learned in
step 1. Nothing routed to memory: every finding is recorded in the tree
(AGENTS.md, the ADRs, this ledger), which is where the discipline says it
belongs.
