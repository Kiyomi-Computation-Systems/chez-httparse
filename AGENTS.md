## Project guidelines

* Use the functional core / imperative shell pattern
* Follow the 12 Factor Apps philosophy
* Project is specific to Chez Scheme and will be a Chez library.
* Project should be portable across macos (darwin), linux, and windows
* Project should be portable across amd64 and arm64
* Plans live in `/.plans`, decision records in `/.plans/decisions`
* Add entries to `CHANGELOG.md` for each release
* `Makefile` should have a `help` command which lists all of its commands
* Use TDD / test-driven development
* A test that passes whether the code is right or wrong is worse than no test.
  Every decision in a module gets a mutation that breaks it, and the owning
  specification must notice. Seed an output variable before asserting it is empty.

  **A test is not finished when it passes. It is finished when you have watched
  it fail.** Before calling any new assertion done: copy the code under test to a
  scratch location outside the repo, break the specific decision that assertion
  claims to guard, run the suite, and confirm that assertion fails *by name*.
  Then revert and confirm it passes again. State the evidence when you report.
  - The mutation must break the test *through the asserted property*. If it fails
    for some other reason — a side effect of the edit, a syntax or import error —
    it has proved nothing. Narrow the mutation until the failure is the one you
    predicted.
  - If no mutation can break the assertion, the assertion is empty. Rewrite it, or
    write down in the mutation log that the property is uncovered and why. Leaving
    it silently is the exact failure this rule exists to prevent.
  - **Expect a value only success can produce.** Ask what *else* yields it.
    Truthiness is the obvious trap — in Scheme almost everything is true, so
    `test-assert` is where empty tests hide — but `#f` is worse: it is what a
    missing key returns, what a defaulting accessor returns, and what a
    swallowed exception returns. Prefer a sentinel no failure path produces.
* **Prefer a check to a comment.** When you are about to write a comment stating
  an invariant — these two things must stay equal, this must run before that,
  never call X from here — ask first whether it can be a make target, a test, or
  an assertion. A stated rule does not enforce itself, and the person who most
  needs the comment is the one who did not read it.

  This is not abstract. The rule above about empty tests was already written down
  here, and five tests violating it shipped anyway; it only started holding once
  it carried an executable standard. A Makefile comment requiring the `chez-srfi`
  submodule and `Akku.lock` to name the same commit was violated *in the same
  commit that introduced it*, and only became true once it was `make check-pins`.
  When a comment is load-bearing, that is the signal it should not be a comment.

* **Closing Ritual:** squash merge PR, catch local `main` up, clean up
  branches, reflect on the session. Run all four parts without asking which.
  A squash merge leaves the branch unreachable by ancestry, so `git branch -d`
  refuses it and `-D` is required — diff against `main` first to confirm
  nothing unique is being dropped. The reflection is a retrospective, not a
  summary of what was done.

## Traps this repo has already hit

Each of these shipped a passing test or a working-looking build that was wrong.
None is obvious from reading the code.

* **`0` is truthy in Scheme, and `guard` returns the body's value when nothing
  raises.** So `(test-assert "…" (guard (e ((pred e) #t) (#t #f)) (accessor x)))`
  passes even when `accessor` never raises — freed pointer fields are zeroed, and
  `0` satisfies `test-assert`. Assert on *what was raised*, compared against an
  expected value, with a distinct sentinel for the no-raise case. Three tests
  guarding the liveness mechanism passed against code with that mechanism deleted.
* **SRFI-64 turns any exception in a test's *actual* expression into `#f`**
  (`vendor/chez-srfi/%3a64/testing-impl.scm:568-571`: the R6RS
  `%test-evaluate-with-catch` is `(guard (ex (else #F)) …)`). An assertion
  expecting `#f` therefore passes when the code under test raises. Never make
  `#f` the expected value of an assertion that can raise — use a sentinel the
  failure path cannot produce: `'agree (or (compare …) 'agree)`. A whole
  differential leg reported 79/79 green against a `cmark-gfm` that crashed on
  every fixture, because the helper's raise on a non-zero exit was swallowed.
* **Chez evaluates argument expressions right-to-left in compiled library code**,
  left-to-right when interpreted.
