# Development and CI both use these targets and the checked-in CMake presets.
# Windows has no make in the base install, so these are a convenience over the
# presets, never the only way in: `cmake --preset dev` and `ctest --preset pr`
# work identically everywhere.
#
# An empty selection is a failure, never a silent pass. That rule lives in the
# test presets themselves (execution.noTestsAction), not only here, or the
# preset path documented above would quietly accept what this path rejects --
# and the whole point of the paragraph above is that the two are equivalent.
# CTEST_FLAGS keeps --no-tests=error as well so an older CTest still refuses.
